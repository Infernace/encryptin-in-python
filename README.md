# encrypting

Key Generation: The generate_key function generates a key and saves it to a file named secret.key. This key is required for both encryption and decryption.

Load Key: The load_key function loads the key from the secret.key file.

Encrypt Message: The encrypt_message function takes a plaintext message, loads the encryption key, and returns the encrypted message.

Decrypt Message: The decrypt_message function takes an encrypted message, loads the decryption key, and returns the decrypted plaintext message.


Run the script to generate a key and save it to a file.
The script will encrypt a sample message and print the encrypted and decrypted messages.
